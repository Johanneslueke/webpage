# Introduction

C is a powerful, high-level programming language that was developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. It has since become one of the most widely used programming languages, serving as the foundation for many other languages and systems. C is known for its efficiency, portability, and flexibility, making it an excellent choice for system programming, embedded systems, and high-performance applications.

In this tutorial, we will cover all the essential features of C, including syntax, data types, control structures, functions, pointers, arrays, structures, file I/O, and more. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a solid understanding of C programming and be able to write complex programs.

# 1. Getting Started

## Installing a C Compiler
To write and run C programs, you need a C compiler. Popular choices include GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) for Linux and MinGW for Windows. You can also use integrated development environments (IDEs) like Code::Blocks or Eclipse for a more comprehensive coding environment.

## Writing Your First Program
Let's start with a simple "Hello, World!" program to get a feel for the language.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}

```

## Compiling and Running the Program
To compile the program, save it as hello.c and use the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```sh
gcc hello.c -o hello
```
Then, run the compiled program:
```sh
./hello
```
You should see the output:
```sh
Hello, World!
```

# 2. Basic Syntax

## Comments
Comments are used to explain code and are ignored by the compiler. C supports both single-line and multi-line comments.

```c
// This is a single-line comment

/*
 * This is a multi-line comment
 * that spans multiple lines.
 */

```

## Including Libraries
Libraries provide additional functionality to your programs. The #include directive is used to include standard and user-defined libraries.

```c
#include <stdio.h> // Standard input/output library

```

## The main Function
Every C program must have a main function, which is the entry point of the program.

```c
int main() {
    // Code goes here
    return 0;
}


```

# 3. Data Types and Variables
## Basic Data Types
C provides several basic data types for different kinds of data:

- int - Integer
- float - Floating-point number
- double - Double-precision
- floating-point number
- char - Character

```c
int age = 25;
float height = 5.9;
double weight = 70.5;
char initial = 'A';

```

## Variable Declaration and Initialization
Variables must be declared before they are used. You can also initialize variables at the time of declaration.

```c
int a;         // Declaration
a = 10;        // Initialization

int b = 20;    // Declaration and initialization
```
## Constants
Constants are variables whose values cannot be changed. Use the const keyword to declare a constant.

```c
const int DAYS_IN_WEEK = 7;
```


# 4. Operators
## Arithmetic Operators
C supports basic arithmetic operations:

- \+ Addition
- \- Subtraction
- \* Multiplication
- / Division
- % Modulus (remainder)

```c
int sum = 5 + 3;
int difference = 5 - 3;
int product = 5 * 3;
int quotient = 5 / 3;
int remainder = 5 % 3;
```
## Relational Operators
Relational operators compare two values and return a boolean result:

- == Equal to
- != Not equal to
- \> Greater than
- < Less than
- \>= Greater than or equal to
- <= Less than or equal to

```c
int a = 5, b = 3;
bool isEqual = (a == b);   // false
bool isGreater = (a > b);  // true
```


## Logical Operators
Logical operators perform logical operations on boolean values:

- && Logical AND
- || Logical OR
- ! Logical NOT

```c
bool result = (a > 3 && b < 5); // true
bool result2 = !(a > 3);        // false
```

## Assignment Operators
Assignment operators assign values to variables:

- = Simple assignment
- += Add and assign
- -= Subtract and assign
- *= Multiply and assign
- /= Divide and assign
- %= Modulus and assign

```c
int x = 10;
x += 5;  // Equivalent to x = x + 5;
```

## Increment and Decrement Operators
Increment (++) and decrement (--) operators increase or decrease a variable's value by one.

```c
int i = 5;
i++;  // i is now 6
i--;  // i is now 5

```

# 5. Control Structures
## if, else, and else if
Conditional statements allow you to execute different code based on certain conditions.

```c

int age = 20;

if (age < 18) {
    printf("You are a minor.\n");
} else if (age < 65) {
    printf("You are an adult.\n");
} else {
    printf("You are a senior citizen.\n");
}
```
## switch
The switch statement is used to execute one of many code blocks based on the value of a variable.

```c

int day = 3;

switch (day) {
    case 1:
        printf("Monday\n");
        break;
    case 2:
        printf("Tuesday\n");
        break;
    case 3:
        printf("Wednesday\n");
        break;
    default:
        printf("Invalid day\n");
}
```

## while Loop
The while loop executes a block of code as long as a condition is true.

```c

int i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    printf("%d\n", i);
    i++;
}
```

## for Loop
The for loop is used for iterating over a sequence of values.

c

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    printf("%d\n", i);
}
## do-while Loop
The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but it guarantees that the loop body is executed at least once.

c

int i = 0;
do {
    printf("%d\n", i);
    i++;
} while (i < 5);

## break and continue
The break statement exits a loop, while the continue statement skips the rest of the loop body and proceeds to the next iteration.

c

for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    if (i == 5) {
        break;  // Exit loop when i is 5
    }
    if (i % 2 == 0) {
        continue;  // Skip even numbers
    }
    printf("%d\n", i);
}
# 6. Functions
Defining and Calling Functions
Functions allow you to modularize and reuse code. A function is defined with a return type, name, and parameters.

c

int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    int result = add(5, 3);
    printf("Result: %d\n", result);
    return 0;
}
## Function Prototypes
Function prototypes are declarations of functions that inform the compiler about a function's name, return type, and parameters. They are usually placed at the beginning of the file.

c

int add(int a, int b);  // Function prototype

int main() {
    int result = add(5, 3);
    printf("Result: %d\n", result);
    return 0;
}

int add(int a, int b) {  // Function definition
    return a + b;
}
# Recursion
A function can call itself, which is known as recursion. Recursion is useful for solving problems that can be divided into smaller subproblems.

c

int factorial(int n) {
    if (n == 0) {
        return 1;
    }
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
}

int main() {
    int result = factorial(5);
    printf("Factorial: %d\n", result);
    return 0;
}
# 7. Pointers
## Introduction to Pointers
Pointers are variables that store memory addresses. They are a powerful feature of C that allows for dynamic memory allocation, efficient array handling, and more.

c

int a = 10;
int *p = &a;  // p is a pointer to the address of a

printf("Value of a: %d\n", a);
printf("Address of a: %p\n", p);
printf("Value pointed to by p: %d\n", *p);
Pointer Arithmetic
Pointers can be incremented or decremented to point to the next or previous memory location.

c

int arr[] = {10, 20, 30};
int *p = arr;

for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    printf("Value: %d\n", *p);
    p++;
}
## Pointers and Arrays
Pointers and arrays are closely related. The name of an array is a pointer to its first element.

c

int arr[] = {10, 20, 30};
int *p = arr;

for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    printf("Array value: %d\n", *(p + i));
}
## Dynamic Memory Allocation
Dynamic memory allocation allows you to allocate memory at runtime using functions like malloc, calloc, realloc, and free.

c

int *p = (int *)malloc(5 * sizeof(int));  // Allocate memory for 5 integers

if (p == NULL) {
    printf("Memory allocation failed\n");
    return 1;
}

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    p[i] = i * 10;
    printf("Value: %d\n", p[i]);
}

free(p);  // Free allocated memory
# 8. Arrays
## Declaring and Initializing Arrays
Arrays are collections of elements of the same data type, stored in contiguous memory locations.

c

int arr[5];          // Declaration
int arr2[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};  // Declaration and initialization
## Accessing Array Elements
Array elements are accessed using their indices, starting from 0.

c

arr[0] = 10;
int value = arr2[2];
## Multidimensional Arrays
C supports multidimensional arrays, which are arrays of arrays.

c

int matrix[2][3] = {
    {1, 2, 3},
    {4, 5, 6}
};

printf("Element at [1][2]: %d\n", matrix[1][2]);
# 9. Strings
## String Handling
Strings in C are arrays of characters terminated by a null character ('\0').

c

char str[] = "Hello, World!";
printf("String: %s\n", str);
## String Functions
The string.h library provides various functions for string handling, such as strlen, strcpy, strcat, and strcmp.

c

#include <string.h>

char str1[20] = "Hello";
char str2[] = "World";

strcat(str1, str2);  // Concatenate str2 to str1
printf("Concatenated string: %s\n", str1);

int len = strlen(str1);  // Get length of str1
printf("Length: %d\n", len);
# 10. Structures and Unions
## Structures
Structures allow you to group different data types together.

c

struct Person {
    char name[50];
    int age;
    float height;
};

struct Person p1 = {"John Doe", 30, 5.9};
printf("Name: %s\n", p1.name);
printf("Age: %d\n", p1.age);
printf("Height: %.1f\n", p1.height);
## Unions
Unions are similar to structures, but all members share the same memory location.

c

union Data {
    int i;
    float f;
    char str[20];
};

union Data d;
d.i = 10;
printf("Int: %d\n", d.i);

d.f = 220.5;
printf("Float: %.1f\n", d.f);
## Typedef
The typedef keyword creates a new name (alias) for an existing type.

c

typedef struct {
    char name[50];
    int age;
} Person;

Person p1 = {"Alice", 25};
printf("Name: %s\n", p1.name);
printf("Age: %d\n", p1.age);
# 11. File I/O
## Opening and Closing Files
C provides functions for file input and output through the stdio.h library. Use fopen to open a file and fclose to close it.

c

FILE *file = fopen("example.txt", "r");

if (file == NULL) {
    printf("Error opening file\n");
    return 1;
}

fclose(file);
## Reading and Writing Files
Use fscanf and fprintf for reading and writing formatted data, and fgets and fputs for reading and writing strings.

```c
FILE *file = fopen("example.txt", "w");
fprintf(file, "Hello, File I/O!\n");
fclose(file);

file = fopen("example.txt", "r");
char line[100];
fgets(line, sizeof(line), file);
printf("Read from file: %s", line);
fclose(file);
```

# 12. Preprocessor Directives
Macros
Macros are defined using the #define directive and can be used to create constants or inline functions.

```c


#define PI 3.14159
#define SQUARE(x) ((x) * (x))

printf("PI: %.5f\n", PI);
printf("Square of 5: %d\n", SQUARE(5));
```

## Conditional Compilation
Conditional compilation allows you to compile code selectively using #if, #ifdef, #ifndef, #else, #elif, and #endif.

```c

#define DEBUG

#ifdef DEBUG
printf("Debug mode is enabled\n");
#endif
```
# 13. Memory Management
## Dynamic Memory Allocation
As mentioned earlier, dynamic memory allocation is done using malloc, calloc, realloc, and free.

Example of Dynamic Memory Allocation
```c


int *arr;
int n;

printf("Enter the number of elements: ");
scanf("%d", &n);

arr = (int *)malloc(n * sizeof(int));

if (arr == NULL) {
    printf("Memory allocation failed\n");
    return 1;
}

for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    arr[i] = i + 1;
}

for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    printf("%d ", arr[i]);
}

free(arr);
```
# 14. Advanced Topics
# Function Pointers
Function pointers store the address of a function and can be used to call the function indirectly.

```c
void greet() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
}

void (*funcPtr)() = greet;
funcPtr();  // Call the function through the pointer
```
# Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operators perform operations on binary representations of numbers:

- & AND
- | OR
- ^ XOR
- ~ NOT
- << Left shift
- \>\> Right shift
```c
int a = 5;    // 0101
int b = 3;    // 0011
int result = a & b;  // 0001
printf("AND result: %d\n", result);
```

# Enumerations
Enumerations provide a way to define a set of named integer constants.

```c

enum Weekday { MON, TUE, WED, THU, FRI, SAT, SUN };
enum Weekday today = WED;
printf("Today is day number %d\n", today);
```

# Inline Functions
Inline functions are expanded in line where they are called, potentially improving performance.

```c


inline int square(int x) {
    return x * x;
}

int result = square(5);
printf("Square: %d\n", result);
```
# 15. Conclusion
C is a versatile and powerful programming language with a rich set of features. By understanding its syntax, data types, control structures, functions, pointers, arrays, and advanced topics, you can write efficient and robust programs. This tutorial has provided a comprehensive overview of the C language, and I encourage you to practice writing your own programs to reinforce your learning.

Happy coding!
